# Nodes overlay for contao
You can add a content element to your page and display the selected node content in an overlay. If you specific a stop 
date the content will not be displayed afterward. The content is hidden by default and enabled by javascript. You can 
although configure to show the overlay only once. If the content changes it will be displayed again. To save this state 
we use the localStorage of the browser.
